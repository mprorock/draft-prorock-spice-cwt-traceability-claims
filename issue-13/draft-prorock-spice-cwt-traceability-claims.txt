                          Traceability Claims
           draft-prorock-spice-cwt-traceability-claims-latest

Abstract

   This document defines claims to support traceability of physical
   goods across supply chains, focusing on items such as bills of
   lading, transport modes, and container manifests.  These claims
   standardize the encoding of essential logistics and transport
   metadata, facilitating enhanced transparency and accountability in
   global supply chains.  These claims are registered for use in both
   CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a set of claims intended to enable the
   traceability of physical goods across various stages of
   transportation and storage.  These claims capture critical
   information necessary for documenting the movement of goods in supply
   chains, thereby supporting regulatory compliance and operational
   efficiency.  These claims are defined for both CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs)
   [RFC8392] and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519].

   These claims are informed by the following documents, among others:
   ACE Automated Broker Interface (ABI) CBP and Trade Automated
   Interface Requirements (CATAIR) [CATAIR], Integrated Track and Trace
   for Multi-Modal Transportation [TrackTrace], and Traceability
   Vocabulary v1.0: A vocabulary for traceability in supply chains
   [TraceabilityVocab].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   These claims are designed to enhance transparency in supply chain
   tracking but should be handled securely to prevent unauthorized
   access to sensitive data.  Confidentiality and integrity of these
   claims must be considered, particularly when shared across untrusted
   or unsecured networks.  Use of selective disclosure techniques and
   careful consideration of data minimization requirements SHOULD be
   considered when using these claims.
