                     SPICE Traceability CWT Claims
           draft-prorock-spice-cwt-traceability-claims-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes additional claims for CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) to
   support traceability of physical goods across supply chains, focusing
   on items such as bills of lading, transport modes, and container
   manifests.  These claims aim to standardize the encoding of essential
   logistics and transport metadata, facilitating enhanced transparency
   and accountability in global supply chains.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a set of claims for CBOR Web Tokens (CWT)
   intended to enable the traceability of physical goods across various
   stages of transportation and storage.  These claims capture critical
   information necessary for documenting the movement of goods in supply
   chains, thereby supporting regulatory compliance and operational
   efficiency.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   These claims are designed to enhance transparency in supply chain
   tracking but should be handled securely to prevent unauthorized
   access to sensitive data.  Confidentiality and integrity of these
   claims must be considered, particularly when shared across untrusted
   or unsecured networks.  Use of selective disclosure techniques and
   careful consideration of data minimization requirements SHOULD be
   considered when using these claims.
